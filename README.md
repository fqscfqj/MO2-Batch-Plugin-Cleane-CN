# MO2 Batch Plugin Cleaner

A batch plugin cleaner for Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) that runs your load order via xEdit's Quick Auto Clean. Keeps track of results so when re-run it knows which mods have already been processed.

If you use LOOT it will also check it's master list and mark known good / known dirty plugins accordingly. Note it will not download or update the LOOT master list, so it is only used if you already use LOOT.

# Installation
- Removed either of the above previous versions (BatchPluginCleaner.py) from your MO2 plugins folder.  
While this is an extension to the existing mod, it is no longer a single file, so is moved to it's own folder.
- Place the 'mo2_batch_plugin_cleaner' folder in to your MO2 plugins folder.
